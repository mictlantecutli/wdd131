      <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
      <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the
        commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold
        out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
        never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

      <h2>1 Kings 18:21</h2>
      <p>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God,
        follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>
